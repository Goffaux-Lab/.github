## Welcome to the Goffaux-Lab!

The human face conveys a wealth of complex information (e.g., identity, gaze,
emotion, gender, etc.) critical for social interactions. Despite face
information is conveyed via subtle variations captured by the retina, its
analysis by the human visual system is fast and accurate.

Our goal is to understand how the human brain solves the complex task of face
perception.

By means of psychophysical, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging techniques,
we explore what, when, and where face information is integrated in the brain to
yield rich and complex face percepts.

The lab is part of two research institutes at the Universit√© Catholique de
Louvain (UCL, Belgium): the Institute of Research in Psychology (IPSY) and the
Institute of Neuroscience (IoNS), located respectively in Louvain-la-Neuve and
Brussels.
